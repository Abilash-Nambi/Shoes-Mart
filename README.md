<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Lisiting all products: When the user first navigates to the Shoes mart application they will be presented with a list of all available products including their name short description and price. The product data is received by making a GET request to the backend server using Axios with CORS enabled in the backend expressjs server.
*   Product Details : When the user clicks on a product they will be redirected to a page displaying the product details. The URL path will include the product ID so that the backend expressjs server can get the details of the particular product and send it to the frontend.
*   Navigation : The Shoe Mart application uses React Router to handle navigation. The user can navigate between the product list view and the details view by clicking on links or pressing the back button in their web browser.
